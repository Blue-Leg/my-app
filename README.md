# Random Forest Model Web Interface

This project presents a web interface designed to use a Random Forest model for predictive tasks. It provides an intuitive way to interact with the model and demonstrate its optimal performance.

## Software Demonstration
The web interface includes a software demonstration to showcase the operation of the optimal Random Forest model that has been obtained.

## Getting Started
To run this program, follow these steps:
1. Download the project folder to your local machine.
2. Download the trained model file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EvE6Rm3J-c78kb0ZHl79v4TWmBymav4W/view?usp=drive_link).
3. Place the downloaded `.joblib` file of the trained model into the same folder as the project files. This step is crucial for the correct execution of the program.
